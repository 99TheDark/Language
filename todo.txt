Soon:
• Error for assigning invalid variable name
• Right-side unary operators (++, --, etc)
• Comments by removing things between /* and */ along with // and \n
• If and while conditionals
• String mode
• Runtime erros
• Add types to variables
• Error if two different types are combined in an operator

Later:
• Add a Semantic Analyzer
• Create a name for the language (Perhaps Luna? A little generic of a name but fits with my profile theme)

Bugs:
• Error messages still don't display the correct column
